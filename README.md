# Sample React App

This app was initiated using create-react-app

The idea of this App is to learn how to use api integration in a ReactJs app

It'll fetch gifs from the giphy api and display them in a kendoui grid

### Giphy Api Key
Please make sure you have a working giphy API key set in your local .env file like this:
```
REACT_APP_GIPHY_API_KEY=yourapikeyhere
```
If you don't know how to get a giphy key, [Here is a tutorial provided by giphy](https://support.giphy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020283431-Request-A-GIPHY-API-Key)

## Running the app

Simply navigate to the root directory and run `npm start`
